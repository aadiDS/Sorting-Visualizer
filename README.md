## üìí Description

The Sorting Visualizer offers a practical way to understand sorting algorithms through interactive and visually appealing animations. It supports several commonly used algorithms, such as:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

Each algorithm is visually broken down into steps, helping you comprehend its working mechanism and efficiency. With a simple dropdown menu, you can easily switch between algorithms and test them with different inputs. The animations can be paused at any time, giving you full control to analyze each step carefully.

The application also includes brief descriptions of the algorithms, making it an excellent learning tool for students, developers, and anyone interested in algorithm design.
